**Warning, you must have Python 3.x installed in order to follow any of these steps.
[Click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python.**

## How is the Repository Organized?

Django revolves around applications, where each application is in charge of each feature of our web-application 
(task_tracker, forums fridge, etc). You can see the full list of our application in the `Apps` directory in the root. 
When starting a new application, each directory automatically generates a `urls.py` (contains all the paths to all 
pages), `admin.py` (allows you to register Models (tables in MySQL) in the admin GUI, and `views.py` (renders HTML 
pages or generic classes on a page). 

## To Assemble a Development Environment
>1. Make a directory in your local system where you wish to pull the project from the remote repository.
>
>2. In your terminal/command line<cmd>, navigate to the directory you just created.
>
>3. `git init`  to initialize git
>
>4. `git clone https://github.com/cysong12/COMP-2800-Team-DTC-14-Cominder.git` to copy remote repository from github

Mac/Linux:
>5. If you do not have Python 3.x installed, go to https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python and follow the instructions
>
>6. `source our_env/bin/activate` to activate virtual environment so that you donâ€™t download dependencies separately
>
>7. `python3 manage.py makemigrations`    to migrate database 
>
>8. `python3 manage.py migrate`        to migrate database
>
>9. `python3 manage.py loaddata Apps/fixtures/categories`        to preload data for categories table
>
>10. `python3 manage.py loaddata Apps/fixtures/subforums`               to preload data for sub-forums table
>
>11. `python3 manage.py runserver`                     to run the server on local host on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
>

Windows:
>5. If you haven't already, install Python 3.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
>
>6. `.\our_env\bin\activate` to activate the virtual environment.
>
>7. `python manage.py makemigrations`    to migrate database 
>
>8. `python manage.py migrate`        to migrate database
>
>9. `python manage.py loaddata Apps/fixtures/categories`        to preload data for categories table
>
>10. `python manage.py loaddata Apps/fixtures/subforums`               to preload data for sub-forums table
>
>11. `python manage.py runserver`                     to run the server on local host on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

to view Sports Forum posts, you must update your profile preferences to `Sports`.

## To login with Google/Facebook

>1. go to /admin -> sites and add http://localhost:8000/ to domain names
>
>2. go to /admin -> social applications and add social application, select provider (ex. google), add a name (ex. cominder-google), client id (292593611416-ggoeb5ctqojtc6nja47blarlq6bem6c4.apps.googleusercontent.com), secret key (_P_DaH72qa7kZz8RqJpR1nO0), and move localhost:8000/ to chosen sites

## To create an Admin User and access Detailed Configurations.
>1. Navigate to the project directory `Cominder` on terminal <br/>
>
>2. Type in `python manage.py createsuperuser`. Then, it will prompt you to create an account. Create the account. <br>
>
>3. The account you have just made has admin privileges. Run the localhost server (`python manage.py runserver`) and 
navigate to `localhost:8000/admin` <br>
>
>4. Log in with the account you have just created. Once you are logged in, you should be able to view all objects and 
>users on the website.
