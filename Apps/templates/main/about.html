<h1 class="text-center about-header pt-5">WHAT IS COMINDER?</h1>
<div>
    <p class="text-center card-text pt-4" style="padding-bottom: 8%;">Cominder is a solution to the lazy folks out there. <br><br>
        Ever tried establishing a new habit with Todoist? Or Microsoft To-do?<br><br>
        Sick of having to enter in "do the laundry" every single time? <br><br>
        Well, with Cominder's built in list of tasks, users can add these habits to their daily schedule with one click of a button. <br><br>
        Having to do the same task over and over again, but it's not on the list? We give you the ability to add your own custom tasks to the list.<br><br>
        We also offer a "What's in my Fridge?" feature, where users can choose a list of recipes and automatically generate a shopping list with the needed ingredients. <br><br>
        We have so much more to offer in the coming future, so be prepared!
